# Pathtracing renderer
This is a demo I made to experiment with the frame buffer, pathtracing, and temporal accumulation and reprojection.
It features monte-carlo integration, rough reflection and refraction with the fresnel effect, anti-aliasing and temporal acculumation.

### Compile with CMake
``mkdir build``  
``cd build``  
``cmake ../``  
``cmake --build .``

### Navigate
- Arrow keys to move
- Move the mouse to pan the view
- Escape to toogle mouse lock and movement
- R to reset the buffer
